# Logistic Regression
This model is trained using Logistic Regression which is one of the most used classification algorithms of Machine Learning.
<br/>
<br/>
The major difference between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression is that Logistic Regression is used to classify discrete values whereas Linear Regression is used to classify continuous values.

## DEPENDENCIES
Install numpy, pandas and matplotlib [here](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
<br/>
<br/>
Install seaborn [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)

## DATASET
The data used for training has 30,000+ samples which is pretty good for training purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
The data is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)

## TRAINING AND ANALYSIS
I have used various histograms and plots as these to analyse the data and it's dependencies.
<br/>
<br/>
Education distribution in the dataset:

<br/>
## ACCURACY
This is the accuracy I achieved as I have considered hours per week as the dependent variable.
