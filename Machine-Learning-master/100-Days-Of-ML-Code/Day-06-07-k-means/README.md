## K-MEANS IMPLEMENTATION FROM SCRATCH
We implement k-means from scratch with following major steps for ML process:
1. Data Pre Processing
2. Data Analysis
3. Model Implementation
4. Result Visualization

Basic steps for k-means algorithm:
STEP 1: Choosing random value of k centroids from the values present in dataset(k=2 here)
STEP 2: Calculate Euclidean distance for each point with each centroid
STEP 3: Comparing the distances and assigning clusters
STEP 4: Taking mean and repeat till zero error

## DATASET
Dataset used for athlete data implementation is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmetuzgor/my-first-data-analysis-with-athletes-data/data).

Dataset for Sales data implementation is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).

 I also have written a blog about detailed implementation [here](https://medium.com/@diti.modi/k-means-clustering-implementation-2018-ac5cd1e51d0a)
