# k-Means Clustering
This is the basic algorithm of unsupervised learning which is used to divide the data into clusters without providing labels to the model.
<br/>
I have used the credit card fraud detection dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The labelled column is only used for accuracy calculation and is ignored while applying the algorithm.

## Dependencies

Install scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib libraries of Python. Jupyter notebook is used for the execution.
