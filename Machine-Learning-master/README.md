# Machine-Learning
Hello World!<br/>
<br/>
This repository is for all the machine learning models implementation that I implement on my own using various datasets for analysis and application.
<br/>
<br/>Hope you find what you looking for!
Models implemented till date-
1. [Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/ditsme/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Linear-Regression/Temperature-Humidity%20relation%20in%20Mumbai%20June%202018.ipynb)
2. [NLP Basic Text Analysis using NLTK](https://github.com/ditsme/Machine-Learning/blob/master/NLP/NLP-NLTK.ipynb)
3. [ANN model](https://github.com/ditsme/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Neural%20Networks/ANN.py)

# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Overview

These are the instructions for [this]() video on Youtube by Siraj Raval for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge.

## Motivation

I had started learning Machine Learning as a new subject but later on I greatly developed affinity to this subject and have started coding and improving my skills in the same since I started knowing about the huge applications of ML in the progress of technology and specially healthcare areas. Siraj Raval has only motivated me more to pursue ML by means of this challenge.

I will now onwards maintain a log file for logging my daily ML work. Thankyou Siraj Raval!

The work is compiled here- [#100DaysOfMLCode](https://github.com/ditsme/Machine-Learning/tree/master/100-Days-Of-ML-Code)
